- caching is implemented, but not used yet
(after app reset, pokemons are loaded into async storage but list is still built from fetches)

todo
- error handling with special routes (??)
- ui

how pokemons are stored in asyncstorage

1. list of indexes at key 'pokemon_index_ids'
[1,2,..,100] means i loaded 100 pokemons 

pokemon_{id}
{
  id: number;
  name: string;
  image: string; // github url
}

pokemon_desc_{id} keep the description loaded when we open pokemon details

at favourite we keep  
{
  name: string;
  image: string;
  description: string;
}
